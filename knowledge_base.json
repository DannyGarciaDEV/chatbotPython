Storage limit is the largest among the three, and it can be read on the client-side. SessionStorage: Stores data only for a session, deleted when the tab or window is closed. Can survive page reloads, and it has a larger storage limit than a cookie. It can be read on the client-side. Cookie: Stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent requests. Expiration varies based on the type and can be reset from either server-side or client-side. Primarily used for server-side reading but can be read on the client-side too. Size must be less than 4KB. Cookies can be made secure by setting the httpOnly flag as true. Cookies only allow you to store strings."

            "answer": "<script>: Used to define a client-side script, stops rendering process and downloads and runs a script. <script async>: If async is present, the script is executed asynchronously with the rest of the page. It doesn't stop the rendering process while asynchronously downloading the script. When the download is finished, it stops rendering and runs the script. <script defer>: Tells the browser to execute the script file only after the HTML document has been fully parsed. It doesn't stop the rendering process while asynchronously downloading the script. When rendering is finished, it runs the script."

        {
            "question": "Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS <link>s between <head></head> and JS <script>s just before </body>? Do you know any exceptions?",
            "answer": "Placing <link> in <head> optimizes a website. HTML and CSS are parsed simultaneously, creating the DOM and CSSOM needed to create the visuals. Placing <script> before </body> allows the user to see the HTML and CSS before the functionality begins. An exception is when using `document.write()`, which is generally considered bad practice. In that case, placing the script in the <head> by using the `defer` attribute achieves the same effect of downloading and running the script after HTML is parsed."

        {
            "question": "What is progressive rendering?",
            "answer": "Progressive rendering is a rendering mode in which the program gradually updates small parts of the entire image, refining it from low quality to the final result. It focuses on rendering the critical content first and progressively renders non-critical content later. This concept depends on streaming HTML from the server to the client, rendering critical content without waiting for non-critical content. It increases popularity and reliability."
        },
        {
            "question": "Why would you use a srcset attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.",
            "answer": "The srcset attribute in an image tag is used to serve different images to users depending on their device width. It allows serving higher quality images to devices with retina displays, enhancing the user experience, while serving lower resolution images to low-end devices, improving performance and reducing data usage. The browser evaluates the content of the srcset attribute by determining the device's width and selecting the most appropriate image from the available options based on the provided descriptors (e.g., image width)."
